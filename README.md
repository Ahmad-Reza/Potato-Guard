# **Potato Disease Classification: A Mobile App for Early Detection**

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model designed to classify potato plant images into three categories: healthy, late blight, and early blight. 
The model is deployed on Google Cloud Platform and integrated into an Android application. 
Farmers can use this app to diagnose plant diseases by capturing or uploading images of their potato plants.
